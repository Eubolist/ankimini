AnkiMini - A small webserver for mobile devices like the iphone/zaurus
=======================================================================

To install on an iPhone/iPod touch, you'll need a jailbroken phone, wireless
access, and Cydia. Installation is simple: locate Anki in Cydia and install.

AnkiMini can also be run on other platforms such as a zaurus, windows mobile,
etc. However, until someone submits installation instructions, this is an
exercise left up to the reader.
