AnkiMini - A small webserver for mobile devices like the iphone/zaurus
=======================================================================

To install on an iPhone/iPod touch, you'll need a jailbroken phone, wireless
access, and Cydia. Installation is simple: locate Anki in Cydia and install.

AnkiMini can also be run on other platforms such as a zaurus, windows mobile,
etc. However, until someone submits installation instructions, this is an
exercise left up to the reader.

Changes:
--------

---------------
AnkiMini 2.0.3:
---------------

- embedded images will work
- multiple sounds on one page will work
- don't wait until sounds have finished playing to return page

---------------
AnkiMini 2.0.2:
---------------

- ETA displayed in compact format
- Changes from Ken Chatfield:

1. have added an option in the settings to toggle the display of the
intervals on the buttons - when off, the buttons show 'Hard', 'Good'
and 'Easy' instead of an interval
2. have added some css styles to the answer buttons such that they are
not so 'round' (actually uses some css3 attributes supported by safari
to simulate the iphone button style while customising the curve radius
at the edges so it is less extreme)
3. have made the default bodytext arial/helvitica (although this can
still be changed using a custom stylesheet, I think)
4. have added an option to display a divider between q/a as in the
full version of anki
5. have specified a minimum height of the q/a 'area' so that if both
are short enough to fit on a single screen the interface buttons will
always be displayed at the bottom - thus remaining in exactly the same
position on both the 'question' and 'answer' side of the card so the
user doesn't have to go 'searching' for the ranking buttons
6. have modified the spacing of the buttons and styles so there is
less 'jumping around' from q and a side of the card in general
7. have updated the display style used on the auxiliary pages (config,
about, deck selection etc.) so that they look a little more like a
native app, with an iphone-style header for each page
